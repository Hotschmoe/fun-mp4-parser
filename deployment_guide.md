# MP4 Parser Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and deploying your Zig-based MP4 parser that targets WebAssembly.

## Prerequisites

- [Zig 0.13.0](https://ziglang.org/download/) (or newer)
- A modern web browser
- Basic knowledge of command-line tools

## Project Structure

Create a project directory with the following structure:

```
mp4-parser/
├── src/
│   └── mp4_parser.zig
├── build.zig
└── www/
    └── index.html
```

## Step 1: Compile the Zig Code to WebAssembly

1. Copy the Zig code from the `MP4 Parser in Zig v0.13 (WASM)` artifact into `src/mp4_parser.zig`
2. Copy the build script from the `Zig Build Script (build.zig)` artifact into `build.zig`
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd mp4-parser

# Build the WebAssembly binary
zig build -Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall

# The output will be in zig-out/lib/mp4_parser.wasm
```

## Step 2: Prepare the Web Interface

1. Copy the HTML/JS code from the `MP4 Player Integration` artifact into `www/index.html`
2. Copy the WebAssembly binary to the www directory:

```bash
cp zig-out/lib/mp4_parser.wasm www/
```

## Step 3: Serve the Application

You can use any web server to serve the files. Here's a simple way using Python:

```bash
# Navigate to the www directory
cd mp4-parser/www

# Start a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Technical Details

### WebAssembly Integration

The HTML file loads the Zig-compiled WebAssembly module and sets up the necessary imports for browser interaction. The key integration points are:

1. **Memory Management**: WebAssembly modules have their own memory space that's shared with JavaScript through `memory.buffer`.

2. **Function Exports**: The Zig code exports several functions that are called from JavaScript:
   - `addData`: Adds a chunk of MP4 data to the internal buffer
   - `parseMP4`: Parses the buffered MP4 data
   - `logBytes`: Logs a specified number of bytes to the console
   - `resetBuffer`: Clears the internal buffer
   - `getBufferUsed`: Returns the number of bytes in the buffer

3. **Function Imports**: The WebAssembly module imports functions from JavaScript:
   - `consoleLog`: For logging messages to the browser console
   - `createVideoElement`: For creating a video element with the processed data

### MP4 Format Basics

The parser handles the basic MP4 container format, which consists of "boxes" (also called atoms). Each box has:

- A 4-byte size field
- A 4-byte type field (e.g., 'ftyp', 'moov', 'mdat')
- Box-specific data

The parser identifies these boxes and logs their types and sizes to help understand the structure of the MP4 file.

## Customization

You can extend the parser to handle specific MP4 features:

1. **Metadata Extraction**: Enhance the parser to extract metadata from the 'moov' box.
2. **Streaming Support**: Modify to support fragmented MP4 files for streaming.
3. **Visual Effects**: Add custom WebGL effects using the logged byte data.

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Issues**: If loading local files, you may encounter CORS errors. Make sure to serve your files from a proper web server.
- **Large Files**: The current implementation uses a fixed buffer size. For larger files, consider implementing a more sophisticated memory management strategy.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure your browser supports WebAssembly. All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) should work fine.

## Further Optimization

For production use, consider these optimizations:

1. **Chunk Processing**: Process MP4 data in smaller chunks to handle large files more efficiently.
2. **Web Workers**: Move the parsing logic to a Web Worker to prevent UI blocking.
3. **SIMD Instructions**: Use SIMD instructions in Zig for faster processing when available.
